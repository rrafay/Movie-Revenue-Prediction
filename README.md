# Movie Revenue Prediction
I have predicted the movie revenue from their initial budget. This is officially a Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/tmdb-box-office-prediction). The dataset is extracted from TMDB. I have predicted the revenue for 4398 movies. I used a Simple Linear Regression model to predict the revenue. The model accuracy is evaluated by by RMSLE (Root Mean Squared Logarithmic error.)
